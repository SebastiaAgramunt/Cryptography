      " this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society what is concerned here is not the morale of masses whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work but the morale of the party itself even the humblest party member is expected to be competent industrious and even intelligent within narrow limits but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear hatred adulation and orgiastic triumph in other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war it does not matter whether the war is actually happening and since no decisive victory is possible it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly all that is needed is that a state of war should exist the splitting of the intelligence which the party requires of its members and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war is now almost universal but the higher up the ranks one goes the more marked it becomes it is precisely in the inner party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest in his capacity as an administrator it is often necessary for a member of the inner party to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink meanwhile no inner party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real and that it is bound to end victoriously with oceania the undisputed master of the entire world  all members of the inner party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith it is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon the search for new weapons continues unceasingly and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet in oceania at the present day science in the old sense has almost ceased to exist in newspeak there is no word for science the empirical method of thought on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded is opposed to the most fundamental principles of ingsoc and even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty in all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards the fields are cultivated with horseploughs while books are written by machinery but in matters of vital importancemeaning in effect war and police espionagethe empirical approach is still encouraged or at least tolerated the two aims of the party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought there are therefore two great problems which the party is concerned to solve one is how to discover against his will what another human being is thinking and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand in so far as scientific research still continues this is its subject matter the scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions gestures and tones of voice and testing the truthproducing effects of drugs shock therapy hypnosis and physical torture or he is chemist physicist or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life in the vast laboratories of the ministry of peace and in the experimental stations hidden in the brazilian forests or in the australian desert or on lost islands of the antarctic the teams of experts are indefatigably at work some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars others devise larger and larger rocket bombs more and more powerful explosives and more and more impenetrable armourplating others search for new and deadlier gases or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailingship others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the suns rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earths centre  but none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization and none of the three superstates ever gains a significant lead on the others what is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess in the atomic bomb a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to discover although the party according to its habit claims the invention for itself atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteenforties and were first used on a large scale about ten years later at that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centres chiefly in european russia western europe and north america the effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society and hence of their own power thereafter although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at no more bombs were dropped all three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later and meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years helicopters are more used than they were formerly bombing planes have been largely superseded by selfpropelled projectiles and the fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable floating fortress but otherwise there has been little development the tank the submarine the torpedo the machine gun even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use and in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the press and on the telescreens the desperate battles of earlier wars in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks have never been repeated  none of the three superstates ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat when any large operation is undertaken it is usually a surprise attack against an ally the strategy that all three powers are following or pretend to themselves that they are following is the same the plan is by a combination of fighting bargaining and welltimed strokes of treachery to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep during this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots finally they will all be fired simultaneously with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible it will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining worldpower in preparation for another attack this scheme it is hardly necessary to say is a mere daydream impossible of realization moreover no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the equator and the pole no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken this explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary eurasia for example could easily conquer the british isles which are geographically part of europe or on the other hand it would be possible for oceania to push its frontiers to the rhine or even to the vistula but this would violate the principle followed on all sides though never formulated of cultural integrity if oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as france and germany it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants a task of great physical difficulty or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people who so far as technical development goes are roughly on the oceanic level the problem is the same for all three superstates it is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners except to a limited extent with war prisoners and coloured slaves even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion war prisoners apart the average citizen of oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either eurasia or eastasia and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages if he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies the sealed world in which he lives would be broken and the fear hatred and selfrighteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate it is therefore realized on all sides that however often persia or egypt or java or ceylon may change hands the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs  under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud but tacitly understood and acted upon namely that the conditions of life in all three superstates are very much the same in oceania the prevailing philosophy is called ingsoc in eurasia it is called neobolshevism and in eastasia it is called by a chinese name usually translated as deathworship but perhaps better rendered as obliteration of the self the citizen of oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure the same worship of semidivine leader the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare it follows that the three superstates not only cannot conquer one another but would gain no advantage by doing so on the contrary so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up like three sheaves of corn and as usual the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing their lives are dedicated to world conquest but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory meanwhile the fact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of ingsoc and its rival systems of thought here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character  in past ages a war almost by definition was something that sooner or later came to an end usually in unmistakable victory or defeat in the past also war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality all rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency so long as defeat meant the loss of independence or some other result generally held to be undesirable the precautions against defeat had to be serious physical facts could not be ignored in philosophy or religion or ethics or politics two and two might make five but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions moreover to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past newspapers and history books were of course always coloured and biased but falsification of the kind that is practised today would have been impossible war was a sure safeguard of sanity and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards while wars could be won or lost no ruling class could be completely irresponsible  but when war becomes literally continuous it also ceases to be dangerous when war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded as we have seen researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for the purposes of war but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming and their failure to show results is not important efficiency even military efficiency is no longer needed nothing is efficient in oceania except the thought police since each of the three superstates is unconquerable each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday lifethe need to eat and drink to get shelter and clothing to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of topstorey windows and the like between life and death and between physical pleasure and physical pain there is still a distinction but that is all cut off from contact with the outer world and with the past the citizen of oceania is like a man in interstellar space who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down the rulers of such a state are absolute as the pharaohs or the caesars could not be they are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals but once that minimum is achieved they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose  the war therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars is merely an imposture it is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another but though it is unreal it is not meaningless it eats up the surplus of consumable goods and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs war it will be seen is now a purely internal affair in the past the ruling groups of all countries although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war did fight against one another and the victor always plundered the vanquished in our own day they are not fighting against one another at all the war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory but to keep the structure of society intact the very word war therefore has become misleading it would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist the peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the neolithic age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different the effect would be much the same if the three superstates instead of fighting one another should agree to live in perpetual peace each inviolate within its own boundaries for in that case each would still be a selfcontained universe freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger a peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war thisalthough the vast majority of party members understand it only in a shallower senseis the inner meaning of the party slogan war is peace   winston stopped reading for a moment somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered the blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden book in a room with no telescreen had not worn off solitude and safety were physical sensations mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body the softness of the chair the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek the book fascinated him or more exactly it reassured him in a sense it told him nothing that was new but that was part of the attraction it said what he would have said if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order it was the product of a mind similar to his own but enormously more powerful more systematic less fearridden the best books he perceived are those that tell you what you know already he had just turned back to chapter i when he heard julias footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet her she dumped her brown toolbag on the floor and flung herself into his arms it was more than a week since they had seen one another  ive got the book he said as they disentangled themselves  oh youve got it good she said without much interest and almost immediately knelt down beside the oil stove to make the coffee  they did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour the evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane from below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boots on the flagstones the brawny redarmed woman whom winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard there seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub and the line alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep he reached out for the book which was lying on the floor and sat up against the bedhead  we must read it he said you too all members of the brotherhood have to read it  you read it she said with her eyes shut read it aloud thats the best way then you can explain it to me as you go  the clocks hands said six meaning eighteen they had three or four hours ahead of them he propped the book against his knees and began reading   chapter i ignorance is strength  throughout recorded time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have been three kinds of people in the world the high the middle and the low they have been subdivided in many ways they have borne countless different names and their relative numbers as well as their attitude towards one another have varied from age to age but the essential structure of society has never altered even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes the same pattern has always reasserted itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far it is pushed one way or the other   julia are you awake said winston  yes my love im listening go on its marvellous  he continued reading   the aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable the aim of the high is to remain where they are the aim of the middle is to change places with the high the aim of the low when they have an aimfor it is an abiding characteristic of the low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily livesis to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again for long periods the high seem to be securely in power but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently or both they are then overthrown by the middle who enlist the low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice as soon as they have reached their objective the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude and themselves become the high presently a new middle group splits off from one of the other groups or from both of them and the struggle begins over again of the three groups only the low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims it would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind even today in a period of decline the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago but no advance in wealth no softening of manners no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer from the point of view of the low no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters  by the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become obvious to many observers there then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life this doctrine of course had always had its adherents but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant change in the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the high it had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests lawyers and the like who were parasitical upon them and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave the middle so long as it was struggling for power had always made use of such terms as freedom justice and fraternity now however the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command but merely hoped to be so before long in the past the middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown the new middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand socialism a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity was still deeply infected by the utopianism of past ages but in each variant of socialism that appeared from about  onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned the new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century ingsoc in oceania neobolshevism in eurasia deathworship as it is commonly called in eastasia had the conscious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and inequality these new movements of course grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lipservice to their ideology but the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment the familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more and then stop as usual the high were to be turned out by the middle who would then become the high but this time by conscious strategy the high would be able to maintain their position permanently  the new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge and the growth of the historical sense which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century the cyclical movement of history was now intelligible or appeared to be so and if it was intelligible then it was alterable but the principal underlying cause was that as early as the beginning of the twentieth century human equality had become technically possible it was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth in earlier ages class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable inequality was the price of civilization with the development of machine production however the case was altered even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels therefore from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after but a danger to be averted in more primitive ages when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible it had been fairly easy to believe it the idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood without laws and without brute labour had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years and this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change the heirs of the french english and american revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man freedom of speech equality before the law and the like and have even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent but by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authoritarian the earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable every new political theory by whatever name it called itself led back to hierarchy and regimentation and in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about  practices which had been long abandoned in some cases for hundreds of yearsimprisonment without trial the use of war prisoners as slaves public executions torture to extract confessions the use of hostages and the deportation of whole populationsnot only became common again but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive  it was only after a decade of national wars civil wars revolutions and counterrevolutions in all parts of the world that ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully workedout political theories but they had been foreshadowed by the various systems generally called totalitarian which had appeared earlier in the century and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious what kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious the new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats scientists technicians tradeunion organizers publicity experts sociologists teachers journalists and professional politicians these people whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government as compared with their opposite numbers in past ages they were less avaricious less tempted by luxury hungrier for pure power and above all more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition this last difference was cardinal by comparison with that existing today all the tyrannies of the past were halfhearted and inefficient the ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas and were content to leave loose ends everywhere to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking even the catholic church of the middle ages was tolerant by modern standards part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance the invention of print however made it easier to manipulate public opinion and the film and the radio carried the process further with the development of television and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument private life came to an end every citizen or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching could be kept for twentyfour hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda with all other channels of communication closed the possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the state but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects now existed for the first time  after the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties society regrouped itself as always into high middle and low but the new high group unlike all its forerunners did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard its position it had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly the socalled abolition of private property which took place in the middle years of the century meant in effect the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before but with this difference that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals individually no member of the party owns anything except pet\n"
